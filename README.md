## üìù Overview

The AI-Powered Breast Cancer Prediction System is designed to provide an intuitive interface for a complex machine learning task. It allows users‚Äîranging from students to researchers‚Äîto interact with a predictive model based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. Users can input 30 cellular characteristics and receive an immediate risk assessment.

Beyond a simple prediction, the application enhances user understanding by:
1.  **Visualizing** the risk score and the most influential factors behind the prediction.
2.  **Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM)** to interpret the results and provide context-aware lifestyle and follow-up recommendations.
3.  **Maintaining a session log** that can be reviewed and exported, facilitating analysis and record-keeping.

The multi-page design ensures a clean, organized workflow, guiding the user from introduction through data entry, analysis, and reporting.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Page Navigation:** A clean sidebar separates the application into logical sections: Introduction, Patient Input, Prediction Visuals, AI Recommendations, and History.
- **Versatile Data Input:** Supports three methods for data entry: manual input for all 30 features, one-click loading of pre-defined samples (High Risk, Low Risk), and batch processing via CSV file upload.
- **Real-Time Model Inference:** Utilizes a pre-trained Logistic Regression model to deliver instantaneous predictions and probability scores upon user request.
- **Interactive Data Visualization:** Powered by Plotly, the app features:
    - A **Risk Gauge** for an immediate, intuitive understanding of the malignancy probability.
    - A **Feature Importance Chart** that dynamically displays the top factors contributing to the current prediction.
    - A **Session Summary Pie Chart** showing the distribution of predictions.
- **Generative AI Recommendations:** Integrates with the Google Gemini model via LangChain to translate the numerical prediction into easy-to-understand, personalized advice.
- **Session Logging and Export:** All predictions are timestamped and logged in a history table, which can be cleared or exported to a CSV file for external analysis.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack

This application is built with a modern Python stack, integrating machine learning, generative AI, and web development frameworks.

- **Frontend & UI:**
  - **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** The core framework used to build the interactive, multi-page web application with pure Python.

- **Machine Learning & Data Handling:**
  - **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/):** Used for loading and running the pre-trained Logistic Regression model.
  - **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):** For robust data manipulation, primarily for creating DataFrames from user input to feed into the model.
  - **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/):** For efficient numerical operations.
  - **[Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/):** For serializing and deserializing the Scikit-learn model file (`.joblib`).

- **Generative AI Integration:**
  - **[Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.com/):** Provides the Gemini model for generating human-like recommendations.
  - **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/):** Acts as the orchestration framework to connect to the Gemini API, manage prompts, and parse the output seamlessly.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/):** Used to create rich, interactive, and aesthetically pleasing charts (gauge, bar, pie) that are natively supported by Streamlit.

## üî¨ The Dataset & Model

### The Dataset

The model was trained on the **[Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- **Content:** It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric features computed from a digitized image of a fine-needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
- **Features:** These describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and concavity.
- **Objective:** The goal is to classify a tumor as either **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** based on these features.

### The Machine Learning Model

The application uses a pre-trained **Logistic Regression** model.
- **File:** `logistic_regression_model.joblib`
- **Rationale:** Logistic Regression is a robust and interpretable algorithm for binary classification tasks, making it an excellent choice for this problem. It provides not only a classification (Malignant/Benign) but also a probability score, which is crucial for the risk assessment feature.
